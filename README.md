# RetailDB Project

## Overview
This project analyzes sales and inventory data from a retail database using SQL and Python (Jupyter Notebook). It includes CSV files, SQL scripts, and notebooks showing data cleaning, queries, and insights.

## Repository Structure
- `/notebooks/` – Jupyter Notebooks with analysis and queries
- `/sql/` – SQL scripts for creating tables, inserting data, and queries
- `/data/` – CSV files with the raw data
- `README.md` – this file

## Steps / Pipeline
1. Load CSV files into SQL tables using SQLAlchemy.
2. Clean and preprocess data (handle nulls, data types, duplicates).
3. Perform SQL queries:
   - Top-selling products
   - Monthly sales trends
   - Store inventory analysis
   - Staff performance metrics
4. Analyze results in Jupyter Notebook.

## Insights
- Example: Top 10 selling products and trends per month.
- Example: Stores with highest inventory.
- Example: Staff handling the most orders.
